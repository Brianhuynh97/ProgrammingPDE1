## Overview
**ProgrammingPDE** is a Python project (part of "Numerical Method for Partial Differential Equations" course at RWTH Aachen University) for solving **1D Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** using the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**. It demonstrates numerical techniques for grid generation, matrix assembly, solving linear systems, and visualizing basis functions efficiently.
