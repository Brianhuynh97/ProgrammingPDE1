## Overview
**ProgrammingPDE** is a Python project developed as part of the **Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations** course at RWTH Aachen University.  
It demonstrates how to solve **1D Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** using the **Finite Element Method (FEM)**, covering:

- Grid generation
- Stiffness matrix assembly
- Right-hand side vector computation
- Linear system solution
- Visualization of basis functions

This project serves as a practical introduction to FEM concepts and their implementation in Python.
